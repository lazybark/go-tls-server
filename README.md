**go-tls-server** is a small lib to create client-server apps using `tls.Conn`. It uses standard libs to create stream-like message exchange protected by TLS. Every message ends with a terminator (:robot:) symbol and the main idea is to read from connection until :robot: appears, then process what we read and repeat reading. This way we can create apps that control their behaviour using any possible custom protocol/message set.

A practical example of how it works you can find in [go-cloud-sync](https://github.com/lazybark/go-cloud-sync).

Connection benchmarks are located at [v3/conn/conn_bench_test.go](https://github.com/lazybark/go-tls-server/blob/main/v3/conn/conn_bench_test.go). They're done via mock TLS connection and w/r ops are performed in memory. But it's still a good place to compare with other solutions.

Cert & key for **Server** & **Client** can be generated via [go-cert-generator](https://github.com/lazybark/go-cert-generator).

**Server** parameters:
* `HttpStatMode (bool)` - allows connections to `HttpStatAddr` to see realtime server statistic
* `HttpStatAddr (string)` - address & port where server should serve stat data if `HttpStatMode = true` (Default: localhost:3939)
* `SuppressErrors (bool)` - prevents **Server** from sending errors into `ErrChan`
* `MaxMessageSize (int)` - sets max length of one message in bytes
* `MessageTerminator (byte)` - sets byte value that marks message end of the message in stream
* `BufferSize (int)` - regulates buffer length to read incoming message
* `KeepOldConnections (int)` - prevents **Server** from dropping closed connection for N minutes after it has been closed
* `KeepInactiveConnections (int)` - makes **Server** close connection that had no activity for N mins

`HttpStatMode` & `HttpStatAddr` should be inaccessible from public network.

**Client** parameters:
* `SuppressErrors (bool)` - prevents **Client** from sending errors into `ErrChan`
* `MaxMessageSize (int)` - sets max length of one message in bytes
* `MessageTerminator (byte)` - sets byte value that marks message end of the message in stream
* `BufferSize (int)` - regulates buffer length to read incoming message
* `DropOldStats (bool)` - make **Client** to set all sent/recieved bytes & errors to zero before opening new connection

### Control connections
**Server** manages connections by deleting old & inactive from connPool. So when you use similar connection pool in your project (to store client-related data), you might need to check if the connection is still active. **Server** stores pointers and deletes them after some period of time, but if your app stores pointers to **Server** connections, then you will not notice the fact that connection was removed from **Server**. It will still be accessible and if it has been closed, you will encounter an error when trying write/read. The best way to check if connection is still usable is to call Connection.Closed().

**Client** connection is closed by calling Client.Close() or by sending 'true' into Client.ClientDoneChan. Second method will trigger Client.Close() from **Client's** internal admin routine. This method exists for flexibility of external apps that will use **Client**.

If you wish to process messages with many routines, still a single routine should read from connection exclusively. It's necessary to avoid problems when reading big byte arrays like files. If you read from one connection by several routines, the data will be corrupted.

In this case, if you need some routine to block the reading for itself, you can call `for { Connection.ReadWithContext }` in this routine and release after some conditions were met. For example, if you want to read file parts after **Client** signals about sending them. This way you will know exactly what to read and when to release.

And if you need to send many files at once - use new connection for each one or for batch of N files.

So basic rule: each connection has exactly one controlling routine that orchestrates writing and reading process at a time.


### Reading
Reading is just an extracting bytes from Connection with Reader interface. When :robot: byte appears, the message returned to calling code. But, if message had bytes after :robot:, then rest of them will be saved for next reading and added at the start of next message. This is a useful feature in case your peer sends several messages at once, but may lead to sudden bugs with some values of reading buffer & max message size. So it's better to send exactly as much bytes as you want to be in one message.

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/IMPORTANT-BC2D33)

Message & close channels of  **Client** are not closed when `Client.Close()` called. It's made by design to keep  **Client** code simple, because there may still be some messages received or errors produced at the moment of `Close()` call. That's why you can still receive messages that were read from TLS connection before it was closed.

### Statistic
Both  **Client** and **Server** have stats that can be useful. 

**Server** has:
* `Stats(year int, month int, day int)` - will return number of bytes sent/received + number of errors or an `ErrNoStatForTheDay`
* `StatsOverall()` - will return all statistic about server for all periods of time summarized
* `StatsConnections()` - will simply return current number of connections in pool
* `ActiveConnetions()` - total number of currently active (usable) connections
* `Online()` - how long the **Server** is online

 **Client** has:
* `Stats()` - will return number of bytes sent/received + number of errors
  
Keep in mind: for server to gather stat data, you need to call `server.SendByte(connection, message)` or `server.SendString(connection, message)`. If you call `connection.SendX()`, it will add sent bytes to connection only.

But it doesn't bother client: it has only one connection and always returns its stats.

Also, server can show statistic via HTTP requests. Use `HttpStatMode: true` and `HttpStatAddr: "DOMAIN:PORT"` in config to enable. But be sure that this endpoint is available only from your internal network or is closed by firewall.

## Basic usage
Basic usage is to use **Server** & **Client** behind an interface or as part of bigger struct. Both return new connections and messages via channels to external calling code which means you can create routines to process new connections and messages in them (as **Server**) or to create separate connections and communicate with **Server** (as **Client**).

So you just run a routine that awaits in connection channel and does some magic when new connection appears. Best way here is to add connection to your internal pool (if you need to manage it with some extra data) and then run goroutine that awaits & processes messages via connection message channel.

### Simple Server code

```
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"log"

	"github.com/lazybark/go-tls-server/server"
)

func main() {
	conf := &server.Config{KeepOldConnections: 1, HttpStatMode: true, HttpStatAddr: "localhost:8080"}
	s, err := server.New("localhost", `certs/cert.pem`, `certs/key.pem`, conf)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	go s.Listen("5555")

	for {
		select {
		case err, ok := <-s.ErrChan:
			if !ok {
				return
			}

			fmt.Println(err)

		case conn, ok := <-s.ConnChan:
			if !ok {
				return
			}

			fmt.Println(conn.Address())

			go func() {
				for m := range conn.MessageChan {
					fmt.Println("Got message:", string(m.Bytes()))
					err = s.SendString(conn, "Got ya!")
					if err != nil {
						log.Fatal(err)
					}
				}
			}()
		}
	}
}

```

### Simple client code
```
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"log"

	"github.com/lazybark/go-tls-server/client"
)

func main() {
	ipsum := `Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Viverra nibh cras pulvinar mattis nunc sed. Congue nisi vitae suscipit tellus. Enim sit amet venenatis urna cursus. Egestas integer eget aliquet nibh. Orci phasellus egestas tellus rutrum tellus pellentesque eu tincidunt. Feugiat vivamus at augue eget arcu dictum varius. Tincidunt praesent semper feugiat nibh sed pulvinar proin gravida. Neque gravida in fermentum et sollicitudin.

	conf := client.Config{SuppressErrors: false, MessageTerminator: '\n'}
	c := client.New(&conf)

	done := make(chan bool)

	go func() {
		for err := range c.ErrChan {
			fmt.Println(err)
		}
	}()

	go func() {
		for m := range c.MessageChan {
			fmt.Println("Got message:", string(m.Bytes()))
		}
		done <- true
	}()

	err := c.DialTo("localhost", 5555, `certs/cert.pem`)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	_, err = c.SendString(ipsum)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	_, err = c.SendByte([]byte{'H', 'i', '!'})
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	<-done
}

```

## Complex usage

### Server
As an example of using the **Server** in bigger project, you can create struct that holds config for **Server**:
```
package server

import "github.com/lazybark/go-tls-server/conn"

type LinkServer struct {
	extConnChan chan (*conn.Connection)
	extErrChan  chan (error)
	certPath    string
	keyPath     string
}

func NewServer(certPath, keyPath string) *LinkServer {
	s := &LinkServer{
		certPath: certPath,
		keyPath:  keyPath,
	}
	return s
}
```
Then create methods to init server and start:
```
package server

import (
	"fmt"

	"github.com/lazybark/go-tls-server/conn"
	gts "github.com/lazybark/go-tls-server/server"
)

// Init prepares server to accept connections
func (s *LinkServer) Init(extConnChan chan (*conn.Connection), extErrChan chan (error)) error {
	s.extConnChan = extConnChan
	s.extErrChan = extErrChan
	return nil
}

// Listen starts net listener
func (s *LinkServer) Listen(addr, port string) error {
	conf := &gts.Config{KeepOldConnections: 1, NotifyAboutNewConnections: true}
	srv, err := gts.New(addr, s.certPath, s.keyPath, conf)
	if err != nil {
		return fmt.Errorf("[Link][Listen]%w", err)
	}

	go srv.Listen(port)

	go func() {

		for {
			select {
			case err, ok := <-srv.ErrChan:
				if !ok {
					return
				}

				s.extErrChan <- fmt.Errorf("[Link][Listen]%w", err)

			case c, ok := <-srv.ConnChan:
				if !ok {
					return
				}

				s.extConnChan <- c
			}
		}
	}()

	return nil
}
```
Now your **Server** can already accept connections. LinkServer struct can be then put into bigger struct that controls your app.

Same goes for **Client**. You create some struct with parameters and client field in it.
```
package client

import (
	"github.com/lazybark/go-tls-server/client"
)

// LinkClient  works with lazybark/go-tls-server to implement ISyncLinkClientV1 interface
type LinkClient struct {
	certPath   string
	akey       string
	cid        string
	serverAddr string
	serverPort int
	login      string
	pwd        string
	c          *client.Client
}

// NewClient returns new LinkClient
func NewClient(certPath string) (*LinkClient, error) {
	c := &LinkClient{certPath: certPath}

	return c, nil
}
```
Then you add config functions:
```
package client

import (
	"fmt"

	tls "github.com/lazybark/go-tls-server/client"
)

// setAuth sets existing key & session ID to the connection
func (sc *LinkClient) setAuth(akey string, cid string) {
	sc.akey = akey
	sc.cid = cid
}

// Init prepares client to connect
func (sc *LinkClient) Init(port int, addr, login, pwd string) error {

	conf := tls.Config{SuppressErrors: false, MessageTerminator: '\n'}
	c := tls.New(&conf)
	sc.c = c
	sc.serverAddr = addr
	sc.serverPort = port
	sc.login = login
	sc.pwd = pwd

	err := sc.ConnectAndAuth()
	if err != nil {
		return fmt.Errorf("[SyncClient][Init]%w", err)
	}

	return nil
}

// Close closes the client
func (sc *LinkClient) Close() error {
	return sc.c.Close()
}

```
And use ending struct in your client app. For example: to wait and process one single response from **Server**, you can create such method:
```
package client

import (
	"encoding/json"
	"fmt"
)

// Await awaits for exactly one message in the stream and returns its content
func (sc *LinkClient) Await() (MessageModel, error) {
	var m MessageModel
	ans := <-sc.c.MessageChan
	err := json.Unmarshal(ans.Bytes(), &m)
	if err != nil {
		return m, fmt.Errorf("[AwaitAnswer]%w", err)
	}
	return m, nil
}
```
It will return MessageModel, then you can process it and run another Await() after sending new data for server.
